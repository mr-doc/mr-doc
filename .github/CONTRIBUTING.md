# How to Contribute

Want to make Mr. Doc better? Awesome! I _**deeply**_ thank you for checking out Mr. Doc. We need volunteers to help us make Mr. Doc the best documentation generator.

**To contribute**, simply check out any of the issues and create a pull request after making changes in a forked repo.

**When creating an issue**, create the issue with enough descriptions so that it will be easier for us to find the root of the problem. A template will be provided for the issue so creating an issue isn't something that is intimidating.

## Coding Conventions
